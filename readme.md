### Data Wrangling

|No. | Project | Description | Notebook | Notes |
|:--:| :------:| :--------- | :------: | :---: |
|1.| **Data Wrangling using Quandl Api** |  We retrieve financial data of a stock using quandl api and do basic data analysis using plain vanilla python. | [data_wrangling_using_api.ipynb](data_wrangling/api/data_wrangling_using_api.ipynb) | - |
|2.|**Pandas from scratch**| This notebook takes an in-depth look at Pandas, the swiss army knife for data analysis.<ul><li> Exploring pandas data-structures (Series and DataFrame) in detail</li></ul><ul><li>We fetch Google's stock data and perform various data analysis on it which includes reading data from various sources, filter, visualize, and apply statistics on top of it.</li></ul>|[pandas_handson.ipynb](data_wrangling/pandas/pandas_handson.ipynb)|-|
|3.|**Never on a Friday or Turning Tuesday**| A simple exploratory data analysis of stock market data to determine if Tuesdays are *Turning Tuesdays*.| [never_on_a_friday.ipynb](data_wrangling/pandas/never_on_a_friday.ipynb)|-|
|4.|**Handling missing values in pandas**| This notebook provides a good overview of how pandas handle missing values and explores functions it provides to handle missing data.| [handling_missing_data.ipynb](data_wrangling/pandas/handling_missing_data.ipynb)|
|5.|**Mini-Project: Data Wrangling and Transformation with Pandas**| In this mini-project we explore multiple datasets (movie, cast, release) to do an extensive data exploration, analysis and visualtion. | [data_wrangling_transformations_movie.ipynb](data_wrangling/pandas/data_wrangling_transformations_movie.ipynb)| - |
|6.|**Data Wrangling with JSON**| This notebook helps understanding Panda's JSON functionality. It also has some challenges which require some fun data-wrangling (e.g. missing values etc).| [Mini_Project_Wrangling_Json_Exercise.ipynb](data_wrangling/json/Mini_Project_Wrangling_Json_Exercise.ipynb)|-|
|7.|**67 years of Lego**| An exploratory data analysis of fun dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built. Lot of good pandas aggregation| [lego_analysis.ipynb](data_wrangling/exploring_67_years_of_lego/lego_analysis.ipynb)| Source: [Datacamp](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/10)|
|8.|**Explore the crypto-currency Bitcoin market**| In this notebook we do an in-depth analysis of crypto-currency market cap analysis, and visualize top gainers and losers in a fun way! This analysis tells you how risky or profitable this market is currently.|[cryptocurrency_analysis.ipynb](data_wrangling/exploring_the_bitcoin_crypto_market/cryptocurrency_analysis.ipynb)|-|
|9.|**Discovery of Handwashing**| This notebook tells the story of discovery of handwashing, and how Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis brought down the deaths of women who just gave birth caused *childbed* fever .|[discovery_of_handwashing.ipynb](data_wrangling/discovery_of_handwashing/discovery_of_handwashing.ipynb)|-|
|10.|**Exploring evaluation of linux**| This notebook does exploratory data analysis on Linux git commit history. A good lot of pandas!|[exploring_the_evaluation_of_linux.ipynb](data_wrangling\exploring_the_evaluation_of_linux\exploring_the_evaluation_of_linux.ipynb)|-|
|11.|**The github history of Scala Language**| This notebook explore the pull requests of Scala language project on github and does interesting analysis of pull requests based on authors, year, months etc|[EDA_scala_history.ipynb](data_wrangling\the_github_history_of_the_scala_language\EDA_scala_history.ipynb)|Source: [Datacamp](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/163)|
|12.|**Who is drunk and when in Ames, Iowa**|Ames, Iowa is home to Iowa State University. Ames has had its fair share of alcohol-related incidents. (For example, Google 'VEISHEA riots 2014'). In this notebook, we analyze and visualize some breath alcohol test data from Ames that is published by the State of Iowa.|[EDA_Ames_iowa_drinking.ipynb](data_wrangling/who_is_drunk_and_when_in_Ames_Iowa/EDA_Ames_iowa_drinking.ipynb)|Source: [Datacamp](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/475)|


### SQL
|No. | Project | Description | Notebook | Notes |
|:--:| :------:| :--------- | :------: | :---: |
|1.|**SQL Spark at scale**| In this notebook, we work through a series of exercises using Spark SQL and familiarize ourselves with how SQL works with spark.|[Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb](sql/sql_with_spark/Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb)| One of the ways to use this notebook is to try [domino trial](https://trial.dominodatalab.com), create a pyspark workspace and launch this [notebook](https://trial.dominodatalab.com/u/mandliya/springboard-mini-projects/view/aic-5_6_6-sql-at-scale-with-spark-mini-project/Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb), as we need a pyspark environment.|

### Time Series
|No. | Project | Description | Notebook | Notes |
|:--:| :------:| :--------- | :------: | :---: |
|1.|**Working with time series in python**|This notebook teaches basics of time series analysis. We take a fun dataset of Seattle's Fremont Bridge bicycle data and Google's stock data to visualize, understand and work through dates and time in Python|[Time_series_basics.ipynb](time_series/Time_series_basics.ipynb).|Data is fetched directly from web.|
