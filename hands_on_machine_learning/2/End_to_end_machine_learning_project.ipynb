    "In this project, we are going to follow these steps (more or less, as this is just beginning, we might not have all the context, or some step might be very trivial). Let's say at your job, you are given California Census Data to predict median housing price for each block group in California (districts, which typically has population of 600 to 3000).  The data contains various metrices such as population, median income, and median housing prices etc. Let's try to follow the steps above to solve this problem.\n",

    "**Business Objective:** The end goal of the project determines how we plan, build and evaluate the model. It should be very clear why we are building the solution? Let's say our model's output will be input to another ML system which along with our output takes many other signals to determine if it is worth investing in an area or not. This is a typical machine learning pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Solutions:** What if there are already state of art solutions available for this problem? In that case, why re-invent the wheel? It is good idea to gauge performance and architecture of the existing systems. This gives you reference for approaching the problem. Your boss tells you the current process is manual and have error variation of around 20%. In such case, you will like to get your hands dirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describing the task**: Now, we are designing the system.\n",
    "* Is it a supervised, unsupervised or Reinforcement learning task? Supervised, as we have labeled training examples.\n",
    "* Is it a classification, regression or something else? Is is regression as we are going to predict a value.\n",
    "* Should we use online or batch learning? As there is no continuous data flow coming into the system, there is no requirement to adjust the data rapidly, and the data is small, so we will rely on plain batch learning.\n",
