| 3 | 3 | 15 April 2020 | Made very little progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Analyzed the histograms of the housing data, and created test/train sets. In hope of better tomorrow. |
| 2 | 2 | 14 April 2020 | Made some progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Loaded data and described it. Less but some progress. |
| 1 | 2 | 13 April 2020 | Currently reading chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). The chapter has interesting insights on how to approach a machine learning problem end-to-end. |
