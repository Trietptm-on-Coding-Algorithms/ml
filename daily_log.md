| 8 | 8 | 20 April 2020 | Fine-tuning the models using grid search. Chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Too much on plate today, so this is the best I could get done. Much better than nothing!|
| 7 | 7 | 19 April 2020 | Built models using Random Forest, Decision Tree and Linear Regression. Also revised importance of cross validation. All in chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).|
| 6 | 6 | 18 April 2020 | Some good progress in  the chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Data preparation, attribute selection, `scikit-learn`'s transformation, One-hot encoding, pipelines and feature scaling. This is a good productive saturday!|
| 5 | 5 | 17 April 2020 | Continuing the chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Stratified Sampling, Correlation Coefficient and visualization. Slow but steady! |
| 4 | 4 | 16 April 2020 | chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Worked on explaining the RMSE and `test_train_split`. Very slow progress, need to improve. |
| 3 | 3 | 15 April 2020 | Made very little progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Analyzed the histograms of the housing data, and created test/train sets. In hope of better tomorrow. |
| 2 | 2 | 14 April 2020 | Made some progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Loaded data and described it. Less but some progress. |
| 1 | 2 | 13 April 2020 | Currently reading chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). The chapter has interesting insights on how to approach a machine learning problem end-to-end. |
