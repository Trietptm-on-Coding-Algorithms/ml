| 16 | 16 | 28 April 2020 | Just AUC today, revised previous concepts. Continuing Chapter 3 (classification) of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Hoping for a better tomorrow.|
| 15 | 15 | 27 April 2020 | ROC and AUC, and various considerations while choosing threshold.. Continuing Chapter 3 (classification) of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Also used [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall) to under precision, recall, ROC, AUC better. Not a very productive day, but what matters is getting something done. |
| 14 | 14 | 26 April 2020 | Thoroghly understood precision-recall tradeoff by using various examples. Created an [Anki](./anki/) deck. Also learned how to choose the right decision threshold. Continuing Chapter 3 (classification) of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Used various `scikit-learn` functions to understand precision-recall threshold. Also used [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall). |
| 13 | 13 | 25 April 2020 | Continuing Chapter 3 (classification) of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Used `plot_confusion_matrix`, deeper understanding of precision and recall, and learned F1-score|
| 12 | 12 | 24 April 2020 | Chapter 3 (classification) of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Learned confusion matrix again, so not to get confused with it ever again. Precision and Recall. `StratifiedKFold` and `cross_val_predict` of `Scikit-Learn|
| 11 | 11 | 23 April 2020 | Started chapter 3 of the book [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Learned classification basics. Also learned some `matplotlib` and linear algebra.|
| 10 | 10 | 22 April 2020 | All exercises of Chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). `RandomizedSearchCV` with `SVM`, full `Scikit-Learn` pipeline with data preparation, top k feature importances and predictions.|
| 9 | 9 | 21 April 2020 | Finally finished Chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Feature Importance, Test data evaluation and SVM regressor done today! Exercises next!!|
| 8 | 8 | 20 April 2020 | Fine-tuning the models using grid search. Chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Too much on plate today, so this is the best I could get done. Much better than nothing!|
| 7 | 7 | 19 April 2020 | Built models using Random Forest, Decision Tree and Linear Regression. Also revised importance of cross validation. All in chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/).|
| 6 | 6 | 18 April 2020 | Some good progress in  the chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Data preparation, attribute selection, `scikit-learn`'s transformation, One-hot encoding, pipelines and feature scaling. This is a good productive saturday!|
| 5 | 5 | 17 April 2020 | Continuing the chapter 2 of [HOML](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Stratified Sampling, Correlation Coefficient and visualization. Slow but steady! |
| 4 | 4 | 16 April 2020 | chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Worked on explaining the RMSE and `test_train_split`. Very slow progress, need to improve. |
| 3 | 3 | 15 April 2020 | Made very little progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Analyzed the histograms of the housing data, and created test/train sets. In hope of better tomorrow. |
| 2 | 2 | 14 April 2020 | Made some progress in chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). Loaded data and described it. Less but some progress. |
| 1 | 2 | 13 April 2020 | Currently reading chapter 2 End to End Machine Learning of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). The chapter has interesting insights on how to approach a machine learning problem end-to-end. |
